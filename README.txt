January intake here

Greetings,

This is my final version for project 1. Unfortunately, I lost a lot of time trying to set up my station, and then the diffficulty of the content itself. I like it, but I am running out of time fast. I may not be the best, but I won't miss content.

we found out that openCV has a bug that causses trouble when saving videos so, my solution is based on saving the images to a file (output) and the using Movie Maker (the good ol' classics) I made the video from each frame. Again, that's not a pretty solution, but it works.

I am handing in the project to avoid being too far from the deadline, but I'll be practicing on including the linear regression feature. I am not an expert programmer in Python nor openCV, but I am a fast learner. My solution is included in the .py file and the output videos (after processing) are white.mp4 and yellow.mp4.

I am liking the content, unfortunately I wasn't expecting the workload to be that challenging; I love it, I just need the time. All constructive feedback is well apreciated.

Have an excellent day!
