Greetings,

This is my final version for project 1. Unfortunately, I lost a lot of time trying to set up my station, and then the diffficulty of the content itself. I like it, but I am running out of time fast.

Anyway, I missed the part of doing linear regresion (or do research on other mechanism) to make the lines smoother, so I am hand in these versions for the honor. Please don't be too harsh, I have the idea of what I want, but I am not a very experienced programmer in Python and I'd need more time to work on a solution.

Did everyone had just 1 week to work on these? I feel some people had like a month...
